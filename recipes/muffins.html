    <li>1 and 1/2 cups (345g) mashed bananas</li>
    <li>6 Tablespoons (85g) unsalted butter, melted (or melted coconut oil)</li>
    <li>2/3 cup (135g) packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg, at room temperature</li>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C). Spray a 12-count muffin pan with nonstick
      spray or use cupcake liners.
    </li>
    <li>
      Whisk the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg
      together in a medium bowl. Set aside. In a large bowl or in the bowl of
      your stand mixer, mash the bananas. On medium speed, beat or whisk in the
      melted butter, brown sugar, egg, vanilla extract, and milk. Pour the dry
      ingredients into the wet ingredients, then beat or whisk until combined.
      If adding nuts or chocolate chips, fold them in now. Batter will be thick.
    </li>
    <li>
      Spoon the batter into liners, filling them all the way to the top. Bake
      for 5 minutes at 425°F, then, keeping the muffins in the oven, reduce the
      oven temperature to 350°F (177°C). Bake for an additional 16–18 minutes or
      until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean. The total time
      these muffins take in the oven is about 21–23 minutes, give or take. (For
      mini muffins, bake 12–14 total minutes at 350°F (177°C).) Allow the
      muffins to cool for 5 minutes in the muffin pan, then transfer to a wire
      cooling rack to continue cooling.
    </li>
    <li>
      Muffins stay fresh covered at room temperature for a few days or in the
      refrigerator for up to 1 week.
